"""Pure transcript-quality metrics.

These exist so that "did this configuration get better or worse" is a number rather
than an impression. Transcription tuning on this project has twice been reverted
after a change that felt right measured badly, so every knob is now judged by the
same three questions: did the model hallucinate, did it get stuck repeating itself,
and did it get the technical vocabulary right.

Everything here is pure and text-only — the benchmark harness in `scripts/` and the
transcript filter use the same definitions, so a fix is measured by the metric it
was meant to move.
