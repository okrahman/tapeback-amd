"""Parent side of out-of-process transcription.

Spawns `tapeback._worker`, streams its events back, and converts them into the same
`(segments, info)` a direct `Transcriber.transcribe` call returns — so callers do not
have to know which side of a process boundary the work happened on.

Why this exists is in `_worker`'s docstring: a CUDA out-of-memory permanently leaks
VRAM inside the process that hit it, and the only reliable way to give that memory
back is for the process to end.
